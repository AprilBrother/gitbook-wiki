This application is the configuring side in the process of connecting a

understand which are the APIs provided and the correct way to use them.
It is highly recommended to use the Smart Config application example,
and complete a full Smart config process before continuing any further.

mode, it need open the casing and make some wires.

  - Open the casing
  - Short the jumper near the label "Config Mode" on the PCB.
  - Power on the receiver, it will work at AP mode
  - Check the Wi-Fi AP "mysimplelink", connect to it
  - Open the url <http://192.168.1.1> if Wi-Fi connected. You can
    configure the parameters for Wi-Fi now.
