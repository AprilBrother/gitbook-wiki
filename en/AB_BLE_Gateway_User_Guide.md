## Description

AB BLE Gateway is a gateway to connecting BLE devices to network by
WiFi.

## WiFi

Gateway provides two modes -- access point mode and station mode for
WiFi connection.

  - In AP mode, it work as a simple AP supporting DHCP. It can only
    support few WiFi connection in same time. The main purpose of this
    mode is for configuration.
  - In Station mode, it work a client device keeps trying to join to the
    AP in your home or office. After joining the AP, the gateway can
    bridge your BLE devices to the local TCP server of cloud server for
    management.

## BLE

BLE is in scan mode. It scan BLE advertising data from other BLE devices
nearby and then post these datas to server side. The BLE packet format
is in hex format.

Note:

  - Since firmware v1.1 a meta data is added to the first line of BLE
    datas. The meta data is in json format and end with `\r\n\r\n`. An
    example meta data
    `{"v":"1.1","mid":129,"id":"175229","ip":"192.168.1.129"}\r\n\r\n`

## Power

The power input is DC 5V/1A. A power cable is come with every gateway.
One side of the cable is USB-A, the other side is 3.5-1.35MM DC plug.

## Button And LED

Power switch. Push to left side for power on.

    and configure WiFi
4.  If WiFi is ok, the LED stop blink
