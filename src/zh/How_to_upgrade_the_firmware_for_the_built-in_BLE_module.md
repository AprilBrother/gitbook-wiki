### Change the BlueDuino to upgrade mode

  - Open the Arduino IDE
  - Choose right board and serial port etc
  - Upload the sketch
    [soft_serial_leonardo.ino](https://gist.github.com/volca/6333732)
    to BlueDuino
  - Open the "serial monitor" of Arduino IDE and input some AT commands

<!-- end list -->

    AT+NAME?
    AT+SBLUP

The BlueDuino goes to upgrade mode now. It will not accept any other AT
commands.

1.  Download the [SerialBootTool from
    TI](http://processors.wiki.ti.com/images/6/64/SerialBootTool_1_3_2.zip)
2.  Open a serial client such as CoolTerm, Open the serial port with
    setup 115200, 8, n, 1
3.  If you have seen the words "I'm ready for upgrade.", go to step 5
4.  If you haven't seen the words "I'm ready for upgrade.", Re-plug the
    BlueDuino to another usb port and reconnect the serial port.
