# Raspberry PI BLE module

## Descrption

The Raspberry Pi BLE module is a simple BLE module designed to provide a
UART transparent transfer function to the Raspberry Pi platform, without
having to use jumper wires on the Raspberry Pi headers.

Communication to the BLE Module is performed via the Raspberry Pi’s
serial port (RX and TX). Power for the display is supplied from the
Raspberry Pi’s 3.3V bus. No external power is required for the BLE
Module as all power is supplied from the Raspberry Pi, via the Adaptor.

| RPi GPIO pin   | BLE module pin |
| 3.3V (Pin \#2) | VCC            |
| GND (Pin \#6)  | GND            |
| TXD (Pin \#8)  | RXD            |
| RXD (Pin \#10) | TXD            |
|  |

Note that the TXD and RXD connections between the RPi and the Bluetooth
module are crossed, this is what makes one end receive what the other
end sends.
