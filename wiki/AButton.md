## About The Project

AButton is a WiFi connected push button. It support the \#IFTTT
application and its Maker Channel now. The project is modifying of [the
IFTTT Smart Button project from Noel
Portugal](https://www.hackster.io/noelportugal/ifttt-smart-button-e11841).

We use the APixel dev board and a casing of the push light to build the
project. It can works with two AAA battery (1.5V x 2 = 3V).

The push button "boots up" the module by sending a HIGH signal through a
diode to CH_PD. The first thing I do in init.lua is to set GPIO02 to
HIGH, which is connected through a 1K resistor back to CH_PD. When it
done posting to IFTTT it just set GPIO02 to LOW and the module is
disabled.

Please check Noel Portugal 's project. The initial code comes from
him.
