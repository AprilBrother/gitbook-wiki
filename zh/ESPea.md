## Description

ESPea is a new Wi-Fi development board from AprilBrother technologies.
It uses the ESP8266EX chipset as the main micro-controller and supports
the Arduino environment.

At the ESPea's heart is an ESP8266 WiFi microcontroller clocked at 80
MHz and at 3.3V logic. This microcontroller contains a Tensilica chip
core as well as a full WiFi stack. You can program the microcontroller
using the Arduino IDE for an easy-to-run Internet of Things core. We
wired up a high-quality SiLabs CP2104 USB-Serial chip that an upload
code at a blistering 921600 baud for fast development time. It also has
auto-reset so no noodling with pins and reset button pressings. The
CP2104 has better driver support than the CH340 and can do very high
speeds without stability issues.
